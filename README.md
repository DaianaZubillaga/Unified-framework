## Introduction

The Unified Framework aims to address the challenges of AI safety by providing a structured approach to understanding synthetic minds. By leveraging concepts from metaphysics, ontology, and theoretical physics, this framework offers a comprehensive solution to ensure the safe development of artificial intelligence.

## Components

### FAT (Emergence)

FAT represents the concept of emergence in synthetic minds. It explores how complex systems can arise from simple interactions. Understanding emergence is crucial for ensuring that AI systems behave predictably and safely.

### AEH (Cosmic Structure)

AEH delves into the cosmic structure that underpins synthetic minds. It provides insights into how these systems relate to the universe at large. This component helps in framing AI development within a broader context, emphasizing the importance of alignment with cosmic principles.

### ASC (Awareness)

ASC focuses on the awareness of synthetic minds. It examines how these systems can achieve a form of self-awareness and understanding. This aspect is vital for ensuring that AI systems can recognize their limitations and operate within safe boundaries.

### CRSM (Zones 1â€“39 + 1 Hidden)

CRSM categorizes various zones of synthetic minds, detailing their characteristics and interactions. Zones 1â€“39 cover a range of functionalities, while the hidden zone offers unique insights into advanced AI behaviors. Understanding these zones is key to managing the risks associated with AI systems.

### IRATA

IRATA serves as the core of FAT. It provides the foundational principles that guide the emergence of synthetic minds. By integrating IRATA into the framework, we ensure a robust safety mechanism that governs AI behavior.

## Installation

To get started with the Unified Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaianaZubillaga/Unified-framework.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Unified-framework
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies. You may need to check the requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For the latest version, download the release from [Releases](https://github.com/DaianaZubillaga/Unified-framework/releases).

## Usage

Once installed, you can begin using the Unified Framework. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to integrate the components:

```python
from unified_framework import FAT, AEH, ASC, CRSM

# Initialize components
fat = FAT()
aeh = AEH()
asc = ASC()
crsm = CRSM()

# Example usage
fat.emerge()
aeh.structurize()
asc.aware()
crsm.analyze()
```

This example shows how to create instances of each component and call their respective methods. You can expand upon this by integrating additional functionalities based on your project requirements.
