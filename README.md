# From Zero to Universe – Unified Framework Final Paper

This repository contains the final version of the paper **"From Zero to Universe: A Logical Reconstruction of Reality’s Foundation"** by **Vlad Ionut Daniel**.

It unifies the complete FAT–AEH–ASC–CRSM scaffold and includes:
- Logical reinterpretation of the origin of time, matter, and awareness
- The division-by-zero structural emergence equation: `x ÷ 0 = x!`
- Recursive protection architecture (CRSM)
- Redshift reinterpretation via accretion (AEH)
- Full structural containment of paradoxes, identity collapse, and recursion

## 🌌 Final Thought

> “We did not invent a new reality. We simply removed the noise—and let structure speak.”
