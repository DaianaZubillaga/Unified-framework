Reconciling JWST Observations with the FAT-AEH Framework

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed galaxies so distant—and yet so well-formed—that they appear to defy standard cosmological models based on Big Bang inflation and gradual galactic evolution. These observations present a paradox: how could complex, massive galaxies exist so early in the universe’s timeline?

The Foundational Asymmetry Theory (FAT), paired with the Accretion Expansion Hypothesis (AEH), resolves this paradox without contradiction.

The FAT-AEH Explanation

According to FAT:

1. The universe began as a 2D finite plane, perfectly symmetrical and filled with dormant, evenly distributed matter.


2. Time is a separate, infinite, directional field that exists outside of this plane.


3. When Time touches the entire 2D plane simultaneously, it triggers the emergence of Awareness, Entropy, and a curvature that folds the flat plane into 3D structure.



This means:

The entire universe emerged at once, not from a central point, but as a full-field emergence.

The curvature varied across the field depending on local entropy gradients, which led to non-uniform collapse into structure.

Galaxies formed across vast distances at the same origin moment, each being a different ‘fold’ or ‘slice’ of the now-3D spacetime.

Application to JWST Discoveries

The galaxies observed by JWST that appear too mature for their redshift are not early outliers, but simply regions of the original 2D void that collapsed at high density or entropy, forming massive structures quickly.

This structure does not contradict the idea of a young universe—it refutes the need for a sequential, expanding sphere model.

In FAT-AEH:

Expansion is optical and gravitational, not spatial.

Redshift is due to curvature and accretion, not velocity.

The universe is not “expanding outward” but settling inward into structured folds of collapsed matter.

Summary

The JWST anomaly is not a threat to cosmology—it is a confirmation of simultaneous emergence across a curved 3D field. The FAT-AEH model naturally accommodates these distant, evolved galaxies by showing that:

All regions of the universe formed simultaneously.

Each galaxy is a localized entropy response within the larger 3D transformation.

The 2D void curved into 3D at once, seeded by Time’s infinite contact.


This explains why those galaxies are there—because they always were.
